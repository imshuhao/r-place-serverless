Report (weight 30%): 22/22

	7/7 Outline your architecture
		[1] All tools listed and justified
		[1] Explain why Tool1 used was appropriate for the task
		[1] Explain why Tool2 used was appropriate for the task
		[1] Explain why Tool3 used was appropriate for the task
		[1] System diagram is present
		[1] System diagram explains parts of the system, at least somewhat clear
		[1] System diagram is excellent, a great guide to the system, clearly explains it all in appropriate detail

	5/5 Explain how tools interact with each other
		[1] Some explanation of individual tools interaction
		[1] Some explanation of tools interacting on critical functions
		[1] Great explanation of tools interacting on critical functions
		[1] Explanation of interaction for initial board load

	6/6 Justify Design (we mark 3 system strengths)
		[1] Strength 1 listed
		[1] Strength 1 justified/explained
		[1] Strength 2 listed
		[1] Strength 2 justified/explained
		[1] Strength 3 listed
		[1] Strength 3 justified/explained

	4/4 Justify Design (we mark 2 system weaknesses)
		[1] Weakness 1 listed
		[1] Weakness 1 justified/explained
		[1] Weakness 2 listed
		[1] Weakness 2 justified/explained

	Strengths and weaknesses can be taken from:
		Consistency
		Availability
		Partition tolerance
		Load balancing
		Caching
		Disaster recovery
		Orchestration
		Monitoring
		Horizontal scalability
		Vertical scalability
		Security & Permissions
		Latency/Throughput
		Persistence
		Number of simultaneous clients
		â€¦

	0/2 Discussing the system's performance [BONUS]
		[0] Graph showing performance of system under load1
		[0] Analysis of system performance under load1

Demo (weight 40%): 15/15

	6/6 Functionality
		[1] 1 Board is loaded when the site is visited
		[1] 1 1000x1000 board is implemented
		[1] 1 Supports at least 16 colors
		[1] 1 Full board is loaded under 3 seconds
		[0] 1 Full board is loaded under 1 seconds [BONUS]
		[1] 1 Board updates are broadcasted to all active users
			. Refreshing the board periodically is not acceptable
		[1] 1 Spam protection. Users are limited to 1 request per 5 mins (or any other defined time period)

	1/1 Monitoring
		[1] 1 Tools monitor some or all components of the system

	1/1 Availability
		[1] 1 Show the system running in 2 availability zones

	2/2 Security & Permissions
		[1] 1 Show & discuss the IAM roles used
		[1] 1 Show & discuss subnets used
			. If applicable. Some designs might not require subnets. In this case, students must discuss why that is the case

	4/4 Orchestration
		[1] 1 Automate launching the system
		[1] 1 Automate scaling up the system
			. Students with serverless architecture must explain how their system detects and adapts to spikes in performance. If they do not know, they only get 0.5
		[1] 1 Automate scaling down the system
			. Same as above
		[1] 1 Automate shutdowning the system

	1/1 Design quality
		Groups of 2 at least 6-7 tools
		Groups of 3 at least 10-11 tools
		[1] 1 Meet the requirements above

	0/2 Creativity [BONUS]
		[0] 2 Additional features beyond the url shortner canvas application
			. Heatmap
			. Timelapse
			. Other
